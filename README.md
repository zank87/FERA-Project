# FERA Project (Wordpress Theme)

This theme is a project for COP 4813 Internet Programming, in which my team decided to take upon the task to
redesign and implement new features to the old Florida Educational Research Association (FERA) website. I have
worked on the overall aesthetics of the site, utilizing Bootstrap primarily for the overall structure. It is still
a work in progress but we hope that FERA will decide to use our project site when it is complete.
